## üîç **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Hardware Issues**

| Problem | Possible Cause | Solution |
|---------|----------------|----------|
| Camera not working | Loose connection | Check camera ribbon cable |
| Poor image quality | Lens dirty/scratched | Clean lens, check for damage |
| Short battery life | High power consumption | Optimize firmware settings |
| BLE connection issues | Interference | Check for 2.4GHz interference |
| Charging problems | Faulty USB cable | Try different USB-C cable |

### **Hardware Testing**

```bash
# Flash test firmware
cd firmware
idf.py flash monitor

# Check hardware status in serial output
# Look for:
# - Camera initialization success
# - I2S/microphone setup
# - BLE advertising start
# - Memory allocation success
```
