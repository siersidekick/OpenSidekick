## üîå **Wiring and Connections**

**Note**: All pins are pre-configured in the firmware. No external wiring required for basic functionality.

## üîã **Power Management**

### **Power Consumption**
- **Idle**: ~50mA
- **Camera Active**: ~150-200mA
- **BLE Streaming**: ~200-250mA
- **Peak Usage**: ~300mA

### **Battery Life Estimates**
Battery life depends on:
- Camera resolution and quality settings
- Frame rate and streaming frequency
- Audio streaming usage (when implemented)
- BLE connection activity

Typical usage with optimized settings: 2-8 hours depending on battery capacity and usage patterns.

### **Power Optimization Tips**
- Use deep sleep between captures
- Reduce frame rate for longer battery life
- Lower camera resolution when possible
- Disable audio streaming when not needed

## üèóÔ∏è **Mechanical Design**

### **Mounting Solutions**

Hardware mounting solutions and mechanical design are currently in development. This includes:

- Glasses frame integration options
- Battery pack mounting solutions
- Secure camera positioning systems
- Ergonomic design considerations

**Status:** Design and prototyping phase
**Expected:** Q1 2025 release of mounting hardware and assembly documentation

## üìê **Dimensions and Clearances**

### **XIAO ESP32S3 Sense Dimensions**
- Length: 21mm
- Width: 17.5mm
- Height: 7.5mm (with camera)
- Weight: ~5g

### **Mounting Clearances**
- Camera field of view: 66¬∞ diagonal
- Minimum clearance from lens: 15mm
- Recommended mounting height: 5-10mm above frame
- USB-C access: 10mm clearance needed

## üîß **Assembly Instructions**

### **Current Status**

Assembly instructions and mounting solutions are currently in development.

**Available Now:**
- Firmware flashing and testing procedures
- Basic ESP32S3 functionality verification
- Software setup and configuration

**Coming Soon:**
- Complete assembly documentation

For now, focus on firmware development and software testing using the ESP32S3 in a development setup.

## üõ°Ô∏è **Safety Considerations**

### **Electrical Safety**
- Use proper Li-Po battery handling procedures
- Avoid short circuits
- Monitor battery temperature during charging
- Use appropriate fuses if modifying power circuits

### **Mechanical Safety**
- Ensure secure mounting to prevent device falling
- Avoid sharp edges in 3D printed parts
- Test comfort during extended wear
- Consider impact resistance for active use

### **Privacy and Legal**
- Check local laws regarding recording devices
- Consider privacy implications of camera/microphone
- Add visible indicators when recording
- Respect others' privacy in public spaces

## üîç **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Hardware Issues**

| Problem | Possible Cause | Solution |
|---------|----------------|----------|
| Camera not working | Loose connection | Check camera ribbon cable |
| Poor image quality | Lens dirty/scratched | Clean lens, check for damage |
| Short battery life | High power consumption | Optimize firmware settings |
| BLE connection issues | Interference | Check for 2.4GHz interference |
| Charging problems | Faulty USB cable | Try different USB-C cable |

### **Hardware Testing**

```bash
# Flash test firmware
cd firmware
idf.py flash monitor

# Check hardware status in serial output
# Look for:
# - Camera initialization success
# - I2S/microphone setup
# - BLE advertising start
# - Memory allocation success
```
