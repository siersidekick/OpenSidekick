cd opensidekick

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/originalowner/opensidekick.git
```

### **2. Set Up Development Environment**

**For Firmware Development:**
```bash
# Install ESP-IDF
git clone -b v5.0 --recursive https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf.git
cd esp-idf
./install.sh
source export.sh

# Build and test
cd opensidekick/firmware
idf.py build
```

**For Client Development:**
```bash
# Install Python dependencies
cd opensidekick/opensidekick-client
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .

# Run tests
python -m pytest
```

### **3. Create a Branch**

```bash
# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Or a bug fix branch
git checkout -b fix/issue-description
```

## üìã **Development Guidelines**

### **Code Style**

**C/C++ (Firmware):**
- Follow ESP-IDF coding standards
- Use descriptive variable names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions focused and small
- Use proper error handling

**Python (Client):**
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Add docstrings to functions and classes
- Use meaningful variable names
- Include error handling

**HTML/JavaScript (Web Client):**
- Use modern JavaScript (ES6+)
- Follow consistent indentation (2 spaces)
- Add comments for complex logic
- Use semantic HTML
- Ensure mobile compatibility

### **Commit Messages**

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

```
feat: add voice activation support
fix: resolve BLE connection timeout issue
